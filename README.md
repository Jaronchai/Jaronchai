**üêï Hope you'll find something useful here! ‚ö°Ô∏è**

Currently studying, solving problems and learning the world. I usually use utility python to do all my stuff, and occasionally do things in MATLAB and VHDL too. I also do a little static web developments. If you need some help on early level engineering homework, calculus, programming or mechanics, then poke me, I'm all ears.

Tech that I use:

- Machine Learning & Data Analytics (Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn,Tensorflow/Keras, SQL/SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Web Development (HTML, CSS/Bootstrap/SASS, JavaScript/NodeJS/ReactJS, Jekyll, Flask)
- Git, GitHub, MATLAB/Simulink, FPGA/Quartus Prime-VHDL, Raspberry-Pi, C Language
