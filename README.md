## Hi there!! Welcome to my GitHub!

I enjoy coding and solving problems about big data, machine learning, data analytics, mathematics, engineering. I'm always eager to explore new technologies. If you need help with anything related to early-level engineering homework, calculus, programming, or mechanics, just bark at me! I'm always happy to lend a hand.

Have a pawsome day! ðŸŒŸ
