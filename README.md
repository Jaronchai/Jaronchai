Welcome to my GitHub profile! I enjoy coding and solving problems! 🐶

My skills include big data, machine learning, data analytics, mathematics, engineering. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. My favorite language to work with is Python, but I also have experience with R and MATLAB for various engineering applications.

If you need help with anything related to early-level engineering homework, calculus, programming, or mechanics, just bark at me! I'm always happy to lend a hand.

Check out my GitHub repositories to see what I've been up to, and feel free to send me a message if you want to chat or collaborate on a project. Let's create together! 🐾🐾🐾
