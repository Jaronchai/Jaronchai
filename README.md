**🐕 Hope you'll find something useful here! ⚡️**

Currently studying, solving problems and learning the world. If you need some help on early level engineering homework, calculus, programming or mechanics, then poke me, I'm all ears.

I usually use utility python to do all my stuff, and occasionally do things in MATLAB and VHDL too. I also do a little static web developments. Things that I do often are:

- Machine Learning and Data Analytics
- Mathematics and Engineering
- Web Development

Also, check out [my site](https://www.jaronchai.com) for more, and have an awesome day!! 🌟
