Welcome to my GitHub profile! I love to code, solve problems, and make friends! 🐶

My skills include machine learning, data analytics, mathematics, engineering, and web development. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies, so I'm constantly working on new projects and experimenting with different tools and languages.

If you need help with anything related to early-level engineering homework, calculus, programming, or mechanics, just bark at me! I'm always happy to lend a paw and share my knowledge.

My favorite language to work with is Python, but I also have experience with R and MATLAB for various engineering applications. I also love to dabble in static web development and create paw-some websites.

Check out my GitHub repositories to see what I've been up to, and feel free to paw me a message if you want to chat or collaborate on a project. Let's create together! 🐾🐾🐾

Also, check out [my site](https://www.jaronchai.com) for more info and my blog!!
Thank you for stopping by, and have a pawsome day! 🌟
